%Matlab code by Bryan Clarke b.clarke@acfr.usyd.edu.au 
%With:
%- some Kalman filter update code by Tim Bailey, taken from his website http://www-personal.acfr.usyd.edu.au/tbailey/software/
%- error_ellipse by AJ Johnson, taken from Matlab Central http://www.mathworks.com.au/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4705-errorellipse

%The GM-PHD algorithm is from Ba-Ngu Vo & Wing-Kin Ma in:
%B.-N. Vo, W.-K. Ma, "The Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density
%Filter", IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Vol 54, No. 11, November 2006, pp4091-4104

%I have implemented both the linear Kalman filter and extended Kalman
%filter versions of this algorithm; switch between these by
%setting/clearing the variable USE_EKF in GM_PHD_Initialisation.

%Ba-Ngu Vo has kindly allowed me to include his implementation of the Optimal Subpattern Assignment
%(OSPA) metric proposed by D. Schuhmacher, Ba-Tuong Vo & Ba-Ngu Vo in
% Schuhmacher, D.; Ba-Tuong Vo; Ba-Ngu Vo, "A Consistent Metric for Performance Evaluation of Multi-Object Filters," Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on , vol.56, no.8, pp.3447,3457, Aug. 2008

%- Hungarian by Alex Melin (to whom I am also much obliged), also taken from http://ba-ngu.vo-au.com/vo/OSPA_for_Tracks.zip

%The OSPA metric is not essential for the functioning of the filter but
%provides a nice way of analysing performance.

%See the README.txt, the comments and the Vo & Ma paper for more
%information about what this code actually does.

%Step 0: Initialisation
%The EKF version must initialise the Jacobian functions used to linearise
%the observation/prediction models. The simulated measurements are also very
%different; the linear KF is direct observations of target state, the EKF is
%range-bearing measurements. The observation and prediction covariances are
%also different.

%In Vo&Ma, the targets are known at filter initialisation.
%If we want to know about them, set KNOWN_TARGET to 1 in GM_PHD_Initialisation.
%Otherwise they should be initialised after being detected a few times.
%HOWEVER this is not guaranteed - sometimes due to noise or missed
%detections, one or both of the targets will not be tracked. This is just 
%part of the filter and the birth_intensity function.
