%GM_PHD_Update
%Matlab code by Bryan Clarke b.clarke@acfr.usyd.edu.au 

%This file performs a PHD filter update on the targets
%This is basically a brute-force Kalman update of every target with every
%measurement and creating a new target from the update results.

%First we assume that we failed to detect all targets.
%We scale all weights by probability of missed detection
%We already did the prediction step for these so their position &
%covariance will have been updated. What remains is to rescale their
%weight.

%Now we update all combinations of matching every observation with every target in the
%map. 
%First we expand the observation to include velocity (by simple v = delta_x/delta_t for

%That is, how fast would the target have needed
%to move to get from where it was to where it was seen now?

        %If this is the first time a target has been observed, it will have
        %no velocity stored.

        %over 2D.
